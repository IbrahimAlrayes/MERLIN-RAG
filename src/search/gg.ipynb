      "France is among the globe’s oldest nations, the product of an alliance of duchies and principalities under a single ruler in the [Middle Ages](https://www.britannica.com/event/Middle-Ages). Today, as in that era, central [authority](https://www.britannica.com/topic/authority) is vested in the state, even though a measure of [autonomy](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/autonomy) has been granted to the country’s _régions_ in recent decades. The French people look to the state as the primary guardian of liberty, and the state in turn provides a generous program of amenities for its citizens, from free education to health care and pension plans. Even so, this centralist tendency is often at odds with another long-standing theme of the French nation: the insistence on the supremacy of the individual. On this matter historian [Jules Michelet](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jules-Michelet) remarked, “[England](https://www.britannica.com/place/England) is an empire, [Germany](https://www.britannica.com/place/Germany) is a nation, a race, France is a person.” Statesman [Charles de Gaulle](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-de-Gaulle-president-of-France), too, famously complained, “Only [peril](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/peril) can bring the French together. One can’t impose unity out of the blue on a country that has 265 kinds of cheese.”\n",

The city proper is small; no corner is farther than about 6 miles (10 km) from the square in front of [Notre-Dame Cathedral](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Notre-Dame-de-Paris). It occupies a depression hollowed out by the [Seine](https://www.britannica.com/place/Seine-River), and the surrounding heights have been respected as the limits of the city.

As a result, what starts out as the stream’s east bank becomes its north bank and ends as the west bank, and the Parisians therefore adopted the simple, unchanging [designation](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/designation) of Right Bank and Left Bank (when facing downstream).
